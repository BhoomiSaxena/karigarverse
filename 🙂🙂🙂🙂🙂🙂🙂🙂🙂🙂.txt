Thankyou so much Bhoomi to stay with me, 
this is the last time I am commiting to this project I am doing to this project
and I hope you have a good future ahead for yourself, 
you came like a light, 
I cherished each moment that we have spent with in these vacations.
I know I couldn't make this friendship interesting, 

this project was the only way to talk with you, 
I try to remember you through this project


aah, I just remember, I love your arts, I put that 
shin chan art on lock screen. through this I couldn't forget.

I might not be able to look at other arts but I'll just
watch those and think about you.


I know, after the things I said, my feelings, you would try to avoid me
and I wouldn't even force that on you. If that's how it is
then let it be. 

idk why the hell, I am crying while typing this note.
I wouldn't even know you will see this note or not. 

I just hope this note will reach to you, knowing that you still matter 
a lot to me, even though I am nothing to you.

also, whatever happens, whatever problem you'll face, academically,
family, I just want you to know, I am here. 

I may look I am nothing, but trust me... 
I am something that 
people can't be. 

I may look like a fool, but I just let all the things slide.
