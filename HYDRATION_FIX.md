# Hydration Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration mismatches caused by browser extensions (like password managers, form fillers, etc.) that add attributes like `fdprocessedid` to HTML elements before React hydration occurs.

## Solution
We've implemented several fixes to handle these hydration mismatches:

### 1. UI Component Updates
- **Button Component**: Automatically includes `suppressHydrationWarning` for actual button elements (not when used as a child component)
- **Input Component**: Automatically includes `suppressHydrationWarning` for all input elements

### 2. Utility Components
- **NoSSR Component** (`src/components/no-ssr.tsx`): Prevents server-side rendering for components that might cause hydration issues
- **ClientOnly Component** (`src/components/client-only.tsx`): Ensures components only render on the client side

### 3. How to Use

#### Using NoSSR for problematic components:
```tsx
import { NoSSR } from "@/components/no-ssr"

<NoSSR fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <ComponentThatCausesHydrationIssues />
</NoSSR>
```

#### Using ClientOnly for form elements:
```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from "@/components/client-only"

<ClientOnly fallback={<div className="h-10 w-full bg-gray-200 animate-pulse" />}>
  <ComplexFormComponent />
</ClientOnly>
```

### 4. What Was Fixed
- ✅ Button elements in Header component
- ✅ Input elements in Header component  
- ✅ Add to Cart buttons in ProductCard component
- ✅ Newsletter subscription form in HomePage
- ✅ CTA buttons in HomePage

### 5. Browser Extension Compatibility
The `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute tells React to ignore attribute mismatches for specific elements that are commonly modified by browser extensions like:
- Password managers (LastPass, 1Password, etc.)
- Form fillers
- Ad blockers
- Translation extensions

This ensures a smooth user experience regardless of which browser extensions users have installed.

## Testing
To test if the fix works:
1. Run the application in development mode
2. Check the browser console for hydration warnings
3. The warnings should be significantly reduced or eliminated

## Notes
- This fix only suppresses warnings for elements that are commonly affected by browser extensions
- It doesn't affect the functionality of the application
- The fix is safe and follows React best practices for handling external DOM modifications
